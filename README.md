Learning to build machines that learn

I'm following the course on [Hands on RL Course](https://datamachines.xyz/2021/12/06/hands-on-reinforcement-learning-course-part-2-q-learning/)

I'm using neovim as my editor instead of using the notebooks provided in the course. First is because I feel more comfortable, second, I want to try to do it with my own hands.

Yep, I'm using AI to guide me through the course.

## Installation

This project uses python 3.12 and uv for managing the environment.
